# Visual Artist Interface for Generative Models

**Part of [Sundai Club](https://sundai.club/)**

Welcome to the Visual Artist Interface for Generative Models, a project designed to empower artists by enabling them to create, control, and monetize generative models based on their unique artistic styles.

## Overview

This platform allows artists to upload their artwork and train custom models that replicate their style. These models can then be monetized and used in various applications such as digital art creation, design for merchandise, and more, while ensuring the protection of the artists' intellectual property.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/visual-artist-spotify.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
  ```
  cd visual-artist-spotify
  npm install
  ```
## Usage
**Training a New Model**
1. Navigate to the model creation page.
2. Upload a ZIP file containing images that best represent your artistic style.
3. Agree to the terms and decide if you want to publish your model on the marketplace.
4. Click "Create a Model" to begin the training process.
   
For detailed instructions on how to train your model using Replicate, refer to this [standalone repository](https://github.com/sundai-club/fine_tuned_sd2_art_hack).
